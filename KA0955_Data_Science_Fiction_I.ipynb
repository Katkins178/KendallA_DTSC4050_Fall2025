        "\n",
        "**Structured Prompt:**\n",
        "\n",
        "\"You are a science fiction storyteller. Create a short story (approximately 3-4 paragraphs) based on the following dataset, which describes conditions within a fictional system or environment. The story should incorporate the following variables and their potential meanings in a fictional context:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **feature_1:** [Describe a fictional phenomenon that could be represented by this numerical feature. For example, 'temporal energy fluctuations', 'biological mutation rate', 'psychic resonance levels', etc.]\n",
        "* **feature_2:** [Describe a fictional phenomenon that could be represented by this numerical feature. For example, 'atmospheric distortion index', 'neural network feedback', 'reality shift magnitude', etc.]\n",
        "* **feature_3:** [Describe a fictional phenomenon that could be represented by this numerical feature. For example, 'technological anomaly frequency', 'genetic drift coefficient', 'dimensional rift occurrence', etc.]\n",
        "* **feature_4:** [Describe a fictional phenomenon that could be represented by this numerical feature. For example, 'cybernetic integration level', 'mental stability index', 'quantum entanglement variance', etc.]\n",
        "* **feature_5:** [Describe a fictional phenomenon that could be represented by this numerical feature. For example, 'environmental decay rate', 'sentient AI activity', 'subspace communication interference', etc.]\n",
        "* **target_variable:** [Describe a fictional outcome that could be represented by this numerical target variable. For example, 'population stability', 'resource production efficiency', 'anomaly containment success', etc.]\n",
        "* **categorical_1:** [Describe a categorical variable, like 'species type', 'technological class', 'environmental zone', etc.]\n",
        "* **categorical_2:** [Describe a categorical variable, like 'social hierarchy', 'communication protocol', 'dimensional access level', etc.]\n",
        "* **name_1:** [Use these as character first names.]\n",
        "* **name_2:** [Use these as character last names.]\n",
        "* **zip_code:** [Use these as location identifiers or zone codes.]\n",
        "* **date:** [Use these as dates of important events or observations.]\n",
        "* **location:** [Use these as the original location or region of a character or object.]\n",
        "\n",
        "The story should include a central mystery or problem related to the `target_variable` and how it is influenced by the other variables. Make it clear that some of the data is missing, and that this makes the problem more difficult to solve. The story should also imply that a linear regression model could be used to better understand the relationship between the target variable and the features.\n",
        "\n",
        "Please ensure the story is engaging and uses the generated character names and location identifiers naturally. The story should include at least 3 characters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example of how to write the story.\n",
        "In the year 3042, the inhabitants of the biodome known as sector 7 were facing a crisis. The population stability was rapidly declining, and no one knew why. Dr. Anya Sharma, using the data collected, believed that the temporal energy fluctuations were the root cause. While other sectors were thriving, sector 7 struggled to survive. She wanted to use a linear regression model to prove her theory, but the data was incomplete.\n",
        "\n",
        "Please create the story.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "**Tips for Writing Structured Prompts:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Define the Role:**\n",
        "    * Start by clearly defining the AI's role (e.g., \"You are a science fiction storyteller\"). This sets the context and guides the AI's response.\n",
        "2.  **Specify the Task:**\n",
        "    * Clearly state what you want the AI to do (e.g., \"Create a short story...\").\n",
        "3.  **Provide Context:**\n",
        "    * Give the AI any necessary background information (e.g., \"based on the following dataset...\").\n",
        "4.  **List Variables and Their Meanings:**\n",
        "    * Explicitly list each variable and provide a potential fictional meaning. This helps the AI understand how to incorporate the data into the story.\n",
        "5.  **Set Constraints:**\n",
        "    * Specify any constraints, such as the length of the story or specific elements to include (e.g., \"approximately 3-4 paragraphs\").\n",
        "6.  **Provide Examples:**\n",
        "    * Providing a short example of how to incorporate the data into the story can be very helpful.\n",
        "7.  **Use Clear Formatting:**\n",
        "    * Use bullet points or numbered lists to organize the information and make the prompt easier to read.\n",
        "8.  **Be Specific:**\n",
        "    * The more specific you are, the better the AI's output will be.\n",
        "9.  **Iterate and Refine:**\n",
        "    * Don't be afraid to experiment with different phrasings and structures. You may need to refine your prompt based on the AI's initial responses.\n",
        "10. **Include Example Data:**\n",
        "    * Adding a few example data points can further improve the AI's understanding of the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "By using a structured prompt, you can guide the AI to generate a story that is both creative and relevant to your dataset, providing a valuable learning experience for your students.\n"

        "\n",
        "* **asteroid_impact:** The frequency and severity of nearby asteroid impacts.\n",
        "* **solar_flare_intensity:** The intensity of solar flares affecting the colony.\n",
        "* **alien_signal_strength:** The strength of mysterious alien signals detected.\n",
        "* **temporal_anomaly_index:** A measure of temporal anomalies observed in the region.\n",
        "* **cybernetic_enhancement_level:** The average level of cybernetic enhancements among the colonists.\n",
        "* **colony_population_growth:** The observed population growth rate.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, they have demographic data on the colonists, including sex, brain wave patterns, names, zipcodes, birthdates, and state of origin (from Earth).\n",
        "\n",
        "Martian Central Command needs your help to build a linear regression model that can predict the colony population growth rate based on these factors. They suspect that some of the factors may have non-linear relationships or interact with each other. They also know that some data is missing.\n",

        "2.  Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values and potential outliers.\n",

        "4.  Evaluate the model's performance and interpret the coefficients.\n",
        "5.  Write a report explaining your findings and providing insights into the factors that influence Martian colony population growth.\n",
